You can also use the command `make test` to compile the program and test it whith the files in the `test` folder.

## Usage
To use the programm, you must run the executable file `sniffer` with the following arguments:
* `-i` followed by the name of the interface to capture the packets from.
* `-o` followed by the file name to sniffer the packets from.
* ~~`-f` followed by the filter to apply to the packets.~~ (not implemented yet)
* `-v` followed by `0` or `1` or `2` to display more infos in the terminal.
* `-h` to display the help.

## Examples
* `./sniffer -i eth0`: Capture the packets from the interface `eth0`.
  * **Note:** You must run the program with `sudo` if you want to capture the packets from an interface.
* `./sniffer -o capture.pcap`: Capture the packets from the file `capture.pcap`.
* `./sniffer -i eth0 -v 1`: Capture the packets from the interface `eth0` and display more infos in the terminal.
